        <h1>Basic information and Biography </h1>
        <P>My name is Abdul-lateef Abioye, I am a graduate of computer science from the prestigious Lagos state University.
            My journey into tech started when my dad bought me a laptop when I was a teenager. My father was someone that loves anything
            technology which prompted him to get me a laptop so I can learn "COMPUTER". His definition of learning computer was just about
            learning how to use the computer; he did not have an idea of what I was supposed to learn. Luckily for me, he enrolled me
            in a cyber cafe to learn anything relating to computers. My then tutor told my dad it's best to learn desktop publishing.
            This was far back as 2013. I was taught how to operate the computer, like the basics of using a computer and the basics of using Microsoft Office packages.
            Along the line, my tutor then
            was a video editor and graphic designer, so whenever he was working on a project, as a curious teen that I was then, I normally stood behind him to see what
            he was doing. From there, I started practicing what I saw him doing. Along the way, he noticed my interest in graphic design, and he then decided to teach
            me properly. That's how I started learning graphics design. I started by tracing and drawing comic characters and cartoon images. He said the reason for this is that
            it helps me have a strong hand in using the mouse for the curving tool. One core characteristic of a graphic designer is that he or she must be good with curve or blending tools.
            I left the cyber cafe to go to secondary school. After my SSCE and I wrote JAMB, while waiting for admission, my dad enrolled me in a bootcamp to learn "COMPUTER AGAIN".
            My then tutor told me to learn web development. He taught me web design with tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Python. I was able to build functional websites before I left the
            bootcamp. Fortunately for me, I gained admission to study computer science as soon as I finished my web design bootcamp. My days in University focused on the core concepts of computing without a practical approach
            to what we were being taught. Luckily for us, the school allowed students to have industry experience with SIWES. This was when my dad connected me with his friend who helped me get
            my internship at Huawei Technologies Co., at Victoria Island. The experience was new to me. I was assigned to the RNOC (regional network operation center) team of the firm. My daily tasks revolved around
            the work of a site reliability engineer, which sparked my interest in DevOps.

        <h4>REASON FOR JOINING ALTSCHOOL</h4>
        <p>The reason for joining AltSchool program is because of the structured learning mode, which gives students access to structured learning resources and a community of like-minded individuals
        which facilitates growth and fosters learning by doing.</p>
        <h4>MY GOALS FOR SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING PROGRAM</h4>
        <p>My goals for joining AltSchool Africa are to become a well-seasoned Cloud engineer. The course I chose while registering was backend engineering; this came as a mistake from my end, which
        I would rectify when I intend to move to the next semester.</p>
