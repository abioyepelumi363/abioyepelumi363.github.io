    <h1>ASSIGNMENT ONE</h1>
    <H1>BASIC information</H1>
    <P>my name is Abdul-lateef Abioye, i am a graduate of computer science from the prestigious Lagos state University.
        my journey into tech started when my dad bought me a laptop when i was a teenager, my father was someone that loves anything 
        technology which prompted him to get me a laptop so i can learn "COMPUTER", his definition of learning computer was just about 
         learning how to use the computer, he did not have an idea of what i was supposed to learn, luckily for me he enrolled me 
        in a cyber cafe to learn anything relating to computer, my then tutor told my dad it's best to learn desktop publishing, 
        this was far back as 2013, i was taught how to operate the computer, like the basics of using computer, the basics of using Microsoft office packages.
        Along the line, my tutor then 
        was a video editor and graphic designer, so whenever he is working on project, as a curios teen that i was then, i normally stands behind him to see what 
        he is doing, from there i started practising what i saw him doing, along the long he noticed my intereest in graphic design he then decided to teach
        me properly, that how i started learning graphics design, i started by tracing and drawing comic character and cartoon images, he said the reason for this is that 
        it helps me have a strong hand in using the mouse for curving tool, one core characteristics about graphic designer is that he or she must be good with curve or blending tool.
        i left the cyber cafe to go to secondary school, after my ssce and i wrote jamb, i was waiting for admission, the prompted my dad to enroll me in a bootcamp to learn "COMPUTER AGAIN",
        my then tutor then told me to learn wweb developmet, he taught me web design with tools like html, css, javascript, jquery and python, i was able to build functional website before i left the 
        bootcamp. fortunately for me i gained admission to study computer scienec as sson as i finsih my web design bootcamp. my days in University was core concept of computing without practical approach 
        to what we are been taught, luckily for us, the school allow student to have industry experience with SIWES, this was when my dad connected me his friend that helped me worked me been able to do  
        my internship at Huawei Technologies Co., at Victoria island, the experience was new to me, i was assigned to RNOC(regional network operation center) team of the firm, my daily task revolves around
        the work of site reeliablity engineer, which sparked my interest in DevOps.
